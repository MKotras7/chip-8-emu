# # chip-8-emu
A work in progress [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator written in C using the `ncurses` API for the display in a terminal.

## Installation and Usage
 - Download the source code from this repo
 - Compile with `gcc ./chip8.c -lncurses`
 - run the created `a.out` with a path to your ROM, ie: `./a.out ./ROMS/test_opcode.ch8`

## Inputs
Inputs for this emulator are
```
1234
QWER
ASDF
ZXCV
```
## Modes
When the emulator starts, it will be in a 'stepping' mode, when this is active, the emulator will pause in between execution cycles and wait for user input.

 - If the user presses "O" the emulator will pause for 1/4th of a second, the purpose of this is that you can enter inputs to the emulator during this delay.
 - If "P" is pressed the emulator will exit 'stepping' mode and there will be no delay between execution cycles.
 - If anything else is pressed, the emulator will execute the current instruction and once complete will pause until the next input.
## Developing for my emulator
Unlike some CHIP-8 implementations, when the program counter runs off 0xFFF, it will halt execution and will wait for input to close the screen and return to the terminal.
